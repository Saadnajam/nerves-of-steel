timer.py is a simple Python script allowing users to set timer duration.
Upon timer expiry, the user will see the time-up meme.
timer.py uses the **time library** to help keep track of time and the **pillow library** to facilitate the meme display.

Please see the documentation for the library used:
- [time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html)
- [pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
